# HSK-Hanzi-Worksheet
Creating a Hanzi writing worksheet using the vocabulary from an Anki deck.

It is opimized to use on a Ratta Supernote A5x.

For my version, I used this Anki deck https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1144807196.

you need to install reportlab to be able to create the the pdfs.  

And I used following fonts for Chinese and the Strokeorder
- CNstrokeorder.ttf
- STKaiti.ttf
